# What?
This is a proof of concept app to attempt a catalog of open source solutions
in a way that adds category context taken from OWASP's cyber defense matrix ( https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Cyber_Defense_Matrix)
and does rudimentary health ratings for projects based on github stats.

# How
To make it go, either visit:
http://catalog.security.allizom.org/

or

using docker: https://hub.docker.com/r/0x7eff/open-source-catalog-demo/

```
docker pull 0x7eff/open-source-catalog-demo
docker docker run -p80:3000 0x7eff/open-source-catalog-demo
```

For development you can also install meteor ( https://www.meteor.com/)
and run meteor after checking out this repo to do live development.
